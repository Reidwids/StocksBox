## Technologies Used
This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Node.js, MongoDB with mongoose, and Express.js. 

## Getting Started
A free stockfinder API (finnhub) was used to build this app, so keep in mind that there were many limitations in terms of accessing historical data/live data.
  
To check out the app, [click here!](https://stockbox1.herokuapp.com/).

## Next Steps
- Add posts so users can post their actions to a main feed
- Add friends, so people can get updates on what their friends are up to
- Add privacy settings, so people can hide certain actions or portfolios from others
- Make additional graph views to graph each portfolio
